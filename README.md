# MobileBasedPersonalAssisstant
A mobile based personal assistant made as a minor project for university work
This project is a prototype version of my main vision in AI technology. This project performs the basic tasks of the user by taking voice inputs.
The project is an inspiration from both the AI Jarvis from Iron Man and the newly esteemed technology of GPT-4.
As said this project is just a prototype and thus needs a lot of improving and innovation in order to come remotely close to a full fledge smooth AI bot which listens on command, speaks, and does almost all tasks on command.
